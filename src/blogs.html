                <h2>Where I'm <em>From</em></h2>
                <p>
                I am originally from Prague, Czech republic (Background Image) I have been there many times & I absolutely love it. I have been to Bali, Prague, Slovakia, New Zealand & of course Australia!
                I hope that one day my dream job of being a developer will take me to various places around the world<br><br>

                I have a heritage of Romani blood, Most people know them as "Gypsies" but no its not those people who read crystal balls or read your future, We are people we love Music, Dancing & Food! 
                Gypsies are scattered all around the world, even though I was born in Prague I was only 6 months old when my family moved to Australia, We still uphold the Romani traditions, Every year we go
                and perform at the "Woodford Folk Festival", We play music there and teach people how the Romani dance.

                Many people do not know but us Romani people, have our own flag also... here it is.

                <br><br><br>
                <strong>A lot of people do not about the Romani culture but one of the main things we are known for is Music, Here you can listen to traditional Romani song.</strong>

                <p>
                  <br><br>
                I have an extensive interest in Music, I play various instruments such as the Piano, Accordion & Bass.<br><br>
                I have been using Reason for Music production, Logic for Audio recording & FL Studio just to make fun loops!
                But as listed before, Every year we play around the Festival at Woodford & we really have fun doing it,
                Here is a quick clip from 2018's WoodFord Festival of us entertaining.
